In this hands-on course, Christina Truong demonstrates the concepts that form the foundation of CSS, explaining what you need to know to tweak existing CSS and write your own. Christina explains how to add colors and other design elements to take your webpages beyond just black text on a white background. She shows how to use selectors, how the box model defines the spacing and sizing of page elements, and how to style text and manage basic layouts with Flexbox and Grid. She also covers working with advanced selectors, creating fluid layouts, and determining when to use the float and position properties. Plus, at the end of the course, you'll walk away with an actual project—an online résumé page.",

        "With Grid and Flexbox, CSS is changing dramatically. Whereas in the past, creating complex layouts required all sorts of CSS hacks, JavaScript, or both, now you can use Flexbox and Grid—tools designed specifically for layouts—to create responsive web pages with precise, custom layouts. In this course, Emily Kay covers the basics of Flexbox and Grid separately, from syntaxes to properties to how they work in general. After that, she details instances where you may need to use both to accomplish your layout goals. As Emily shows, when you use Flexbox and Grid together to combine their separate strengths, you can create and display complex web content in a beautiful, user-friendly way.",
